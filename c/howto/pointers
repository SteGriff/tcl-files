Say we have  int x=9;  the address of x is given by &x.
You normally have to cast this when you store it:
int y=(int)&x;

When declaring a function with a parameter by reference,
ask like this:
void increment(int *addressOfX){
	*addressOfX += 1;
}
...increment(&myX);
So the variable pointed to by the address of X (which is,
of course, X itself) will increment.

Ergo: Ask for the * to the ADDRESS;
      Pass in the ADDRESS of the var!
