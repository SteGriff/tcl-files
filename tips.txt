# Tiny core linux tips

## Facts (probably)

The window manager is flwm
The terminal window is aterm, it runs /bin/sh which might be a pointer to /bin/ash?
It's probably all handled by busybox anyway
You can use xterm isntead of aterm, aterm has a tranlucent bg, thats the only difference.
the default aterm session is configured 

cliorx is just a tcl utility for wrapping commands, dont know why

## Use me

You have to run backup to actually commit files to the pen drive!!
I wrote a script called shutdown which does backup then shutdown

User bins (or rather symlinks for user programs) go in ~/.local/bin/
You can find out where something really lives using `which x` where x is some executable

You can use alt+tab to change windows, just like in... windows...
Close a window with Esc (like alt+f4)

### Using ls

Cyan items are links/symlinks
blue items are directories
white items are files

## Customising TCL

	cd /etc/sysconfig
	ls

Each item in here configures some component, like which program manages the desktop (flwm_topside) or the icon bar (wbar)
So you can switch out components which is quite cool

## Right click menu

The menu options shown when you right click the desktop or a title bar come from ~/.wmx/
What does wmx stand for?

## Screen resolution

I have obviously fixed the resolution to work with this netbook in the past. Which file initialises this setting?

## Wifi

The wifi command run from the wmx menu is /usr/local/bin/wifi.sh which can be run as just `sudo wifi.sh`
the wifi progam actually comes from `/tmp/tcloop/wifi/user/local/bin/wifi.sh`


## wbar

wbar icons can be set in /usr/local/tce.icons

## keyboard keymaps

`/tmp/tcloop/kmaps/usr/share/kmap/uk.kmap`


## Questions

What is fltk - the flwm toolkit?
How do we get a UK keyboard
keyboard shortcuts and how to add more
xmodmap looks like it adds key aliases
