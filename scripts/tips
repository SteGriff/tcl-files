How to do some things:

Setting console colour
	First, import tc-functions like this:
	. /etc/init.d/tc-functions
	Then echo a colour with $GREEN etc.
	Don't forget to restore with $NORMAL !
Playing with calc
	You can simulate expressions in brackets by making virtual stacks of calc:
	calc 2*$(calc 4+8)
Playing with wallpapers:
	 ~/.setwallpaper and hsetroot
	 NEW! run 'paper', or see ~/scripts/paper.sh
Parameters in sh scripts:
	$0 is the file name of the script as it launches
	$1 onwards contain launch flags!
Run in new console:
	xterm -e [commands]
	like:$ xterm -e chimera2 web/vimanual.html
